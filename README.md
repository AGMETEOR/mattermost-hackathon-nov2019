# Mattermost Hackathon November 22 - 24, 2019

Mattermost is holding a virtual hackathon November 22 - 26 and everyone is invited to participate! You can work on anything to do with Mattermost for your hackathon project but we strongly encourage building a plugin or an integration.

Participants from the community who submit a Hackathon project (https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-hackathon-nov2019) will receive a Mattermost swag bag! Details on the submission to come.

Weâ€™ll end the Hackathon with presentations on Tuesday November 26, 8:00 San Francisco time (11:00 Toronto time, 17:00 Berlin time, 01:00 (+1) Tokyo time). Join virtually at https://zoom.us/j/9887460965, available on PC, Mac, Linux, iOS and Android.
